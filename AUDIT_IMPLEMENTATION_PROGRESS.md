# Audit implementation progress

Last updated: 2026-08-13

## Current position

- Branch: `codex/audit-p0-release`
- Parent branch: `main`
- Last completed commit: `fb5f682` (force-ignore generated directories)
- Current task: P0 packaging and release foundations complete
- Next action: add Changesets and CI/release workflows.

## Completed

- Created the isolated worktree at `.worktrees/audit-p0-release`.
- Installed dependencies with the frozen lockfile using Bun 1.3.12.
- Captured the initial verification baseline.
- Restored the verification baseline with Bun 1.3.12, a product-only Biome scope, and mechanical formatting/import fixes.
- Addressed the P0 review: excluded nested generated `dist` and `coverage` directories from Biome and corrected the P0 product/test file count.
- Addressed the P0 re-review: force-ignored worktrees and generated outputs so Biome's scanner cannot index them through dependency discovery.
- Added deterministic builds for all seven public packages: Bun browser ESM plus declarations for Core/React/Vue/Solid/Vanilla, copied CSS for Styles, and Angular 18.2 APF partial compilation through ng-packagr 18.2.1.
- Replaced package source exports with conditional built-artifact exports, retaining local TypeScript and Bun aliases for the workspace development/test flow.
- Defined React 19-only, Vue, Solid, and Angular peer contracts; moved React types to dev-only; kept internal core dependencies in source as `workspace:*` and rewrote built manifests to `0.1.0`.
- Added deterministic `build`, `pack`, and `test:tarballs` scripts. The smoke contract packs each `dist`, validates contents/manifests, installs all local tarballs with npm outside workspace resolution, and typechecks a seven-package consumer including Angular APF.

## In progress

- No active P0 implementation work.

## Remaining

- P0: Changesets and CI/release workflows.
- P1: runtime architecture, concurrency, cleanup, positioning, accessibility and instance scoping.
- P2: final public contracts, adapter acceptance suite, playground and documentation migration.
- P3: dead-code cleanup, MIT license, package metadata and final release rehearsal.

## Verification log

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `bun install --frozen-lockfile` | Pass; 294 packages installed with Bun 1.3.12. |
| `bun run check` | Pass after P0 re-review; Biome checked 76 files in 27ms with no fixes applied. |
| `bun run typecheck` | Pass after P0 re-review; TypeScript completed with no diagnostics. |
| `bun test` | Pass after P0 re-review; 62 tests, 0 failures across 13 files in 457ms. |
| `bun install` | Pass; resolved Angular packaging dependencies and updated `bun.lock`. |
| `bun run check` | Pass; Biome checked 82 files with no fixes applied. |
| `bun run typecheck` | Pass; TypeScript completed with no diagnostics. |
| `bun test` | Pass; 62 tests, 0 failures across 13 files in 451ms. |
| `bun run build` | Pass; built publishable distributions for all 7 packages. |
| `bun run pack` | Pass; packed 7 local tarballs from `dist` without publishing. |
| `bun run test:tarballs` | Pass; npm-installed, typechecked external consumer for all 7 tarballs including Angular APF. |
| `bun run --cwd apps/playground build` | Pass; Vite built all framework playground entries (Angular bundle warning only). |

## Decisions and deviations

- The implementation runs in an ignored project-local worktree to keep `main` untouched.
- Biome is intentionally scoped to `apps/**`, `packages/**`, and its product configuration files. `!!.worktrees`, `!!apps/**/dist`, `!!apps/**/coverage`, `!!packages/**/dist`, and `!!packages/**/coverage` force-ignore worktrees and generated output recursively, preventing scanner indexing while retaining the product-only source scope.
- The public `boolean | void` action-result type is intentionally retained with a targeted Biome suppression; replacing `void` would alter its public TypeScript contract.
- Angular uses `ng-packagr` 18.2.1 and `@angular/compiler-cli` 18.2.13 with TypeScript 5.5.4, its compatible compiler range. The abstract reactive component is decorated as an Angular directive so partial compilation can emit APF safely.
- Dist manifests are generated from source manifests, strip development-only fields, rewrite `workspace:*` to the actual shared version `0.1.0`, and expose only artifact-relative entries. Generated `dist` and `.artifacts` remain untracked and excluded from Biome.
- The playground was moved to React 19 to match the React adapter peer contract. Vite warns that the Angular demonstration bundle is 1.38 MB minified; this is not changed in P0 because runtime/code-splitting work is outside the packaging scope.

## Main files changed

- `package.json`, `bunfig.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, and `scripts/{build-packages,pack-packages,test-tarballs}.ts`
- `packages/*/package.json`, declaration build configs, `packages/angular/ng-package.json`, and explicit public entrypoints.
- `apps/playground/package.json`, `biome.json`, `.gitignore`, `bun.lock`, and source-manifest contract tests.

## Recovery instructions

1. Open `.worktrees/audit-p0-release`.
2. Confirm the current branch with `git status --short --branch`.
3. Add Changesets and CI/release workflows after reviewing the generated distribution contracts.
